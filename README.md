## mysite2

My website.

`site` is my first iteration, creating a neat SPA with React, logic and all on the client.

That was fun, but I remembered the headache Google can be sometimes with SPA sites. So, to
have a little more fun, I remade the site with Go. `site` is the React version, `site2` is
the current Go version deployed to mukunda.com.
